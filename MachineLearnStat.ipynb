    "In  Python we can calculate the square root of a number in a few different ways but in this assignent the aim is to calculate the square root without using a built in Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real nuber has 2 square roots. The most common analytical methods in finding the square root are iterative and require two steps: finding a suitable starting value, followed by iterative refinement until termination criteria is met. Number can be the starting value, but fewer iterations will be required the closer it is to the final result. The most suitable method for programmatic calculation is Newton's method which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus and will be investogated below. [1, 2, 3, 4].\n",

    "To find the square root $z$ of a number $x$, we can iterate using the following equation. \n",
