    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In  Python we can calculate the square root of a number in many different ways but in this assignent the aim is to calculate the square root without using a built in Python library. One of the method that can be used for that purpose is the Netwon' method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real nuber has 2 square roots. The most common analytical methods in finding the square root are iterative and require two steps: finding a suitable starting value, followed by iterative refinement until termination criteria is met. The most suitable method for programmatic calculation is Newton's method which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus [1, 2, 3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root $b$ of a number $x$ we can use the following equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b_{next} = b - \\frac{b^2 - x}{2b}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With only a few iterations one can obtain a solution accurate to many decimal places. \n",
