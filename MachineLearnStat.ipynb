    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In  Python we can calculate the square root of a number in many different ways but in this task the aim is to calculate the square root without using a built in Python library. One of the method that can be used for that purpose is the Netwon' method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every real nuber has 2 square roots. The most common analytical methods in finding the square root are iterative and require two steps: finding a suitable starting value, followed by iterative refinement until termination criteria is met. The most suitable method for programmatic calculation is Newton's method which is based on a property of the derivative in the calculus [1, 2, 3, 4].\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the square root $b$ of a number $x$ we can use the following equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b_{next} = b - \\frac{b^2 - x}{2b}  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "With only a few iterations one can obtain a solution accurate to many decimal places. \n",

    "This test utilizes a contingency table to analyze the data. A contingency table (also known as a cross-tabulation, crosstab, or two-way table) is an arrangement in which data is classified according to two categorical variables. The categories for one variable appear in the rows, and the categories for the other variable appear in columns. Each variable must have two or more categories. Each cell reflects the total count of cases for a specific pair of categories.[8]\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculation of expected value of the two nominal variables and the test of independence will will be able to conduct hypothesis testing where a test statistic is computed and compared to a critical value. The critical value for the chi-square statistic is determined by the level of significance (typically .05) and the degrees of freedom. If the observed chi-square test statistic is greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis can be rejected.\n",
